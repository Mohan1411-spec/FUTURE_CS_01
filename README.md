WEB APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING
Definition:
Web Application Security Testing is the process of evaluating a web application to identify and fix security weaknesses that attackers could exploit.

🔑 Objectives

Detect vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, Authentication flaws, and Broken Access Control.

Assess how well the app protects confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

Verify compliance with security standards (e.g., OWASP ASVS, PCI-DSS).

🛠️ Common Techniques

Information Gathering – mapping inputs, parameters, endpoints.

Input Validation Testing – checking for SQLi, XSS, command injection.

Authentication & Session Testing – weak passwords, session fixation, token issues.

Access Control Testing – role bypass, IDORs, privilege escalation.

Business Logic Testing – flaws in workflows (e.g., bypassing payment steps).
